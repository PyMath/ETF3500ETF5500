# Boston Housing

- In an earlier tutorial we considered the Boston Housing data.
--

- Each observation is a town (suburb) in the Boston metropolitan area.
--

- There are 14 variables measuring demographic information as well as other factors that may influence house price.

---

# PCA on Boston Housing 

```{r, eval=F,echo=T,message=FALSE}
#First load required packages
library(tidyverse)
Boston<-readRDS('Boston.rds')
Boston%>%
  column_to_rownames('Town')%>% 
  prcomp(scale.=TRUE)->pcaout
screeplot(pcaout,type = 'l')
```

---

# Scree Plot

```{r, eval=T,echo=F,message=FALSE}
#First load required packages
library(tidyverse)
Boston<-readRDS('Boston.rds')
Boston%>%
  column_to_rownames('Town')%>% 
  prcomp(scale.=TRUE)->pcaout
screeplot(pcaout,type = 'l')
```

---

#Biplot

```{r, eval=T,echo=T,message=FALSE}
biplot(pcaout)
```

---

# Discussion

- Nearly 60% of the variation of all variables in explained by just 2 PCs.
--

- Can these PCs be interpreted.
--

- Sometimes they can but in this example it is difficult.
--

- This is not surprising, PCA just finds a linear combination
that maximises variances.
--

- To obtain factors with some interpretation we need a more
detailed model.

---

# Factor Model

- The factor model is defined as

$$y_{ij}=\lambda_{j1}f_{1i}+\lambda_{j2}f_{2i}+\ldots+\xi_{ij}$$
--

- Or in matrix form

$$\mathbf{y}_i=\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\mathbf{f}_i+\boldsymbol{\xi}_i$$

- $y$ are observed data, $\Lambda$ / $\lambda$ are coefficients, $f$ are latent factors, $\xi$ are error terms.
--

- The intercept is left out for simplicity.
---

# Notation

- The subscript $i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ cross sectional unit (in the Boston data the town).
--

- The subscript $j$ denotes the variable (e.g. teacher ratio, distance from downtown etc.)
--

- The dimensions of $\mathbf{y}_i$ and $\boldsymbol{\xi}_i$ are $p\times 1$ (or $14\times 1$ in the Boston data).
--

- If there are $r$ factors then $\mathbf{f_i}$ is $r\times 1$ and $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ is $p\times r$.
--

- Verify that all matrix multiplication is conformable.
---

# Regression

- This is similar to a regression model. However
  - In a regression model there are $x$ on the right hand side that
are *observed*.
  - In a factor model these are replaced with $f$ that are *unobserved*.
--

- How can we estimate this model?
  
---

# Assumptions: Errors

- Each idiosyncratic error has its own variance.
  - These variances are called unique variance or uniquenesses
--

- The idiosyncratic errors are uncorrelated with each other.
  - This is a crucial assumption
--

- Together these imply that $\mbox{Var-Cov}(\boldsymbol{\xi})=\boldsymbol{\Psi}$ is diagonal.

---

# Assumptions: Factors

- The factor and idiosyncratic errors are uncorrelated.
  - This is similar to regression
--

- Each factor has a variance of 1.
  - This is harmless since the factor is latent.
--

- The factors are uncorrelated with each other
  - We relax this assumption later on.
--

- These imply that $\mbox{Var-Cov}(\mathbf{f})=\mathbf{I}$.

---

# Estimation

- In general these assumptions imply that

$$E(\mathbf{y}\mathbf{y}')=\boldsymbol{\Sigma}=\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\boldsymbol{\Lambda}'+\boldsymbol{\Psi}$$
- The variance is decomposed into two parts
--

- Part explained by common factors $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\boldsymbol{\Lambda}'$ . 
  - This is often called the *communality* or *common variance*.
- Part unexplained by common factors $\boldsymbol{\Psi}$. 
  - This is often called the *uniqueness* or *unique variance*.

---

# Estimation

- It is straightforward to estimate $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ with its sample equivalent $\mathbf{S}$
--

- We can then choose values $\hat{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol{\Psi}}$ so that $\hat{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}\hat{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}'+\hat{\boldsymbol{\Psi}}$ is close to $\mathbf{S}$.
--

- There are many  ways to do this
--

- *Maximum likelihood estimation* is one of the most popular.

---

# Estimation issues

- Using *Maximum likelihood estimation* does require a distributional assumption about the data.
--

- The most common assumption is that the data are normally distributed.
--

- Even when this assumption does not hold the maximum likelihood estimate is still quite robust as long as the data do not differ too much from normality.

---

# Number of factors

- There are a number of strategies for selecting factors
  - Scree plot
  - Kaiser rule
  - Hypothesis tests

---

#Heywood cases

- In some rare cases the maximum likelihood converges to an estimate where the unique variances are *negative*.
--

- These are known as *Heywood cases*
--

- Since a variance is cannot be negative this is usually caused by
  - Selecting too many factors
  - Too small a sample size.

# Factor Analysis in R

---

#Using R

- Many packages in R do factor analysis
--

- We use `factanal` from the `stats` package
--

- First step use the following code

```{r, eval=T,echo=T,message=FALSE}
#First load required packages
Boston<-readRDS('Boston.rds')
Boston%>%
  column_to_rownames('Town')%>% 
  factanal(factors = 2,scores = 'none',
           rotation = 'none')->facto
```

---

#Output

```{r, eval=T,echo=T,message=FALSE}
facto$loadings
```

---
#Output

- An advantage of printing the loadings like this is that values close to zero are surpressed.
--

- This will help with the interpretation of factors.
--

- For 2 factors, it can be useful to also plot the factors.
--

- To prepare the data use the `tidy` function in the `broom` package.

---

#Loadings

```{r, eval=T,echo=T,message=FALSE}
library(broom)
fa_df<-tidy(facto) #Get into data frame
```

```{r, eval=T,echo=F,message=FALSE}
kable(fa_df)%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped","hover","condensed"))%>%
  scroll_box(height="500px")

```


---
# Plotting

The plot is clearer if arrows are used

```{r, eval=F,echo=T,message=FALSE}
ggplot(fa_df,aes(x=fl1,y=fl2,
                 label=variable))+
  geom_segment(aes(xend=fl1,
                   yend=fl2,x=0,y=0),
               arrow = arrow())+
  geom_text(color='red',nudge_y = -0.05)
```

---
# Plotting

```{r, eval=T,echo=F,message=FALSE}
ggplot(fa_df,aes(x=fl1,y=fl2,label=variable))+
  geom_segment(aes(xend=fl1,yend=fl2,x=0,y=0),arrow = arrow())+geom_text(color='red',nudge_y = -0.05)
```

---

#Interpretation

It is difficult to interpret these Factors
- Factor 1 seems to take everything into account except the Charles river dummy.
--

- Factor 2 takes everything into account except crime and race.
--

- It would be easier to interpret the factors if Factor 1 loaded onto a small set of variables and Factor 2 loaded onto a different small set of variables.
--

- Can we do this?
---

#Rotations

Recall the model is 

$$\mathbf{y}_i=\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\mathbf{f}_i+\boldsymbol{\xi}_i$$

Assume there is an r Ã— r rotation matrix $\mathbf{R}$. Since $\mathbf{R}'\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{I}$ the model above is equivalent to

$$\mathbf{y}_i=\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\mathbf{R}'\mathbf{R}\mathbf{f}_i+\boldsymbol{\xi}_i$$

---

# The rotation trick

Grouping parts together we have

$$\mathbf{y}_i=\left(\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\mathbf{R}'\right)\left(\mathbf{R}\mathbf{f}_i\right)+\boldsymbol{\xi}_i$$

Now we have new loadings $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}=\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\mathbf{R}'$ and new factors $\tilde{\mathbf{f}_i}=\mathbf{R}\mathbf{f}_i$

- All rotated versions of the loadings and factors explain the data
equally well and satisfy all assumptions of the model.

---

# Varimax

- Some rotated versions of the factors may be easier to interpret.
--

- Generally if there are many zero loadings, then the factors are easy to interpret.
--

- An algorithm known as varimax tries to find a rotation with as many loadings close to zero as possible.
--

- It can be implemented using the `rotation='varimax'` option in `factanal`.

---

#Varimax in R

```{r, eval=T,echo=T,message=FALSE}

Boston%>%
  column_to_rownames('Town')%>% 
  factanal(factors = 2,scores = 'none',
           rotation = 'varimax')->facto_vari
```

---

#Loadings

```{r, eval=T,echo=F,message=FALSE}
fav_df<-tidy(facto_vari) #Get into data frame
kable(fav_df)%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped","hover","condensed"))%>%
  scroll_box(height="500px")

```

---

#Varimax

```{r, eval=T,echo=F,message=FALSE}
ggplot(fav_df,aes(x=fl1,y=fl2,label=variable))+
  geom_segment(aes(xend=fl1,yend=fl2,x=0,y=0),arrow = arrow())+geom_text(color='red',nudge_y = -0.05)

```

---

# Oblique Rotation

- An orthogonal rotation did not work so instead of considering a matrix where $\mathbf{R}\mathbf{R}=\mathbf{I}$, consider a
matrix $\mathbf{G}\mathbf{G}^{-1}=\mathbf{I}$
$$\mathbf{y}_i=\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\mathbf{G}\mathbf{G}^{-1}\mathbf{f}_i+\boldsymbol{\xi}_i$$
--

- Now we have new loadings $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}=\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\mathbf{G}$ and new factors $\tilde{\mathbf{f}_i}=\mathbf{G}^{-1}\mathbf{f}_i$
--

- By setting `rotation='promax'` in `factanal`, an oblique 'rotation' can be carried out.

---


#Varimax in R

```{r, eval=T,echo=T,message=FALSE}

Boston%>%
  column_to_rownames('Town')%>% 
  factanal(factors = 2,scores = 'none',
           rotation = 'promax')->facto_promax
```

---

#Loadings

```{r, eval=T,echo=F,message=FALSE}
fap_df<-tidy(facto_promax) #Get into data frame
kable(fap_df)%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped","hover","condensed"))%>%
  scroll_box(height="500px")

```

---

#Promax

```{r, eval=T,echo=F,message=FALSE}
ggplot(fap_df,aes(x=fl1,y=fl2,label=variable))+
  geom_segment(aes(xend=fl1,yend=fl2,x=0,y=0),arrow = arrow())+geom_text(color='red',nudge_y = -0.05)
```

---

#Possible Interpretation

- Factor 1 is
  - Positively correlated with age.
  - Negatively correlated with distance.
- Factor 1 is a **geographic** factor.  
--

- Factor 2 is
  - Positively correlated with crime, pupil-teacher ratio.
  - Negatively correlated with the race variable.
- Factor 2 is a **socioeconomic** factor.  

---

# More than 2 factors

- If there are more than 2 factors look at the loadings matrix.
--

- The pattern of zeros should give some clue to the
interpretation of the factors.
--

- Also look for large loadings (in absolute value)

---

# Oblique rotation

- Oblique rotations will lead to factors that are correlated with one another.
--

- This is not the case for orthogonal factors.
--

- Other rotation options are available by downloading the
package `GPArotation`
--

- Orthogonal Rotations: Varimax, Quartimax, Equimax
--

- Oblique Rotations: Promax, Oblimin, Quartimin, Simplimax

---

#Factor scores

- The factor scores themselves can be estimated using a variety
of methods. Two are available as options in the factanal
function.
  - Regression Scores
  - Bartlettâ€™s Scores
- Bartlettâ€™s scores are unbiased estimates
- These can be implemented setting `scores='regression'` or `scores='Bartlett'` in `factanal`.

---

#Estimation alternatives

Other estimation methods can also be used for the factor
model.
- One example is *Principal Axis Factoring*, which is available for
R using the `psych` package.
- Principal Axis Factoring does not require the normality assumption and can be adapted for item response data such as Likert scales.

---

# Extended topics

- What we have discussed today is often called *exploratory factor analysis*.
--

- In many social sciences the latent variables may themselves influence other observed variables.
--

- Such models are called *structural equation models*.
--

- They can also be estimated by maximum likelihood.

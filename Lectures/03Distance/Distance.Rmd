# Why distance?
 
- Many problems that involve thinking about how *similar* or dissimilar two observations are.  For example:<!--D-->
--

  + May use the same marketing strategy for *similar* demographic groups.
  + May lend money to applicants who are *similar* to those who pay debts back.<!--D-->
--

- Arguably the most important concept in data analysis is *distance*

---

# Simple example
 
- Consider 3 individuals:<!--D-->
--

  + Mr Orange: 37 years of age earns $75k a year
  + Mr Red: 31 years of age earns $67k a year
  + Mr Blue: 30 years of age earns $68k a year<!--D-->
--

- Which two are the most similar?

---

# On a scatterplot
 

```{r scatter}
plot(c(37,31,30),c(75,67,68),col=c('orange','red','blue'),pch=20,cex=2,main='Distance',xlab='Age (Years)',ylab='Income ($000)',xlim=c(20,45),ylim=c(55,85))
```

---

# Distance as a number
 
- It is easy to think about three individuals but what if there are thousands of individuals?<!--D-->
--

  + In this case it will be useful to attach some number to the distance between pairs of individuals<!--D-->
--

  + We will do it with a simple application of Pythagoras' theorem.

# Euclidean distance
 
- In general there are more than two variables.<!--D-->
--

- Is there a way to apply our intuition in 2 dimensions to higher dimensions?<!--D-->
--

  + Pythagoras' theorem can be *generalised* to higher dimensions.<!--D-->
--

  + This results in a concept of distance called *Euclidean distance*.

---
  
# Euclidean distance
 

We measure $p$ variables for two observations: $x_{j}$ is the measurement of variable $j$ for observation ${\mathbf x}$, $y_{j}$ is the measurement of variable $j$ for observation ${\mathbf y}$.  *Euclidean* distance between ${\mathbf x}$ and ${\mathbf y}$ is:

$$D\left({\mathbf x},{\mathbf y}\right)=\sqrt{\sum\limits_{j=1}^p \left(x_{j}-y_{j}\right)^2}$$

---

# Vectors

- Notice that ${\mathbf x}$ and ${\mathbf y}$ are examples of **vectors**.
--

- For example ${\mathbf x}=\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\x_2\end{pmatrix}$ where $x_1$ is age and $x_2$ is income.
--

- We can think of a data point as 
--

  + A vector of attributes or measurements 
--

  + A point in space 
--

- These are the same thing.

---

# Other kinds of distance
 
- We will nearly always use Euclidean Distance in this unit, however there are other ways of understanding distance 
- One example is the *Manhattan Distance* also known as block distance.

$$D\left({\mathbf x},{\mathbf y}\right)=\sum\limits_{j=1}^p \left|x_{j}-y_{j}\right|$$

---

# Manhattan Distance
 

![Manhattan Distance](ManhattanDistance.png)

---

# Distance and Standardising data
 
- We must be careful about the units of measurement.<!--D-->
--

- Euclidean (and Manhattan) distance change for variables measured in *different units*.<!--D-->
--

- For this reason, it is common to calculate distance after the *standardising* data.<!--D-->
--

- If the variables are all measured in the same units, then this standardisation is unecessary.<!--D-->
--

- Some distances are not sensitive to units of measurement (e.g. Mahalanobis Distance)

---

# Distance in R
 
- R has its own special object for distances known as a `dist` object<!--D-->
--

- It can be obtained using the `dist()` function<!--D-->
--

- We are going to find Euclidean distances between the beers in the beers dataset. Use:<!--D-->  
--

  + Only beers with price greater than $4.50
  + Only numeric variables.
  + Standardised data
  + Use the function `dist` to get the distances.
---

# Load packages and data
 

```{r beerstart, echo=TRUE,message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
Beer<-readRDS('Beer.rds')
```

---

# Find Distances
 

```{r dists, echo=TRUE}
Beer%>%filter(price>4.5)%>% #Only expensive Beers
  select_if(is.numeric)%>% #Only numeric variables
  scale%>%
  dist->d

```


```{r printd}
kable(as.matrix(d),digits=4)%>%kable_styling(font_size=18)
```

---

# Labels

- Only numeric variables were used to compute distances. 
- The names of the beers are not attached to the `dist` object.
- This can be achived by assigning the beer names to `attributes(d)$Labels`
- Here `d` is the `dist` object.

---

# Use Beer Names

```{r distslab, echo=TRUE}
Beer%>%filter(price>4.5)%>% #Only expensive Beers
  pull(beer)-> #Get beer names
  attributes(d)$Labels #"Attach" them to dist object
```
```{r printdb}
kable(as.matrix(d),digits=4)%>%kable_styling(font_size=18)
```

---

# Your Turn
 
- Compute the distance without standardising the data.<!--D-->
--

- Compute the Manhattan distance for standardised data.<!--D-->
--

- Compute the Manhattan distance for unstandardised data.

# Non-Metric

---

# Non-metric Data
 
- Can we define distance when the variables are non metric?<!--D-->
--

- The answer is yes!<!--D-->
--

- We will discuss two approaches:<!--D--> 
--

  + Jaccard Similarity/ Distance
  + Dummy Variables

---
  
# First a motivation
 
- Many people use music streaming services like Spotify.  <!--D-->
--

- One of the attractions of these services is they they recommend artists based on the favourite artists of other users who have similar taste in music.<!--D-->
--

- The data in this case is in the form of a list of favourite artists.

---
 
# Distance in musical taste

- Suppose there are three customers with the following favourite artists<!--D-->
--

  + Customer A: Post Malone, Drake, Lil Peep, Billie Eilish
  + Customer B: Post Malone, Lil Peep, Juice Wrld
  + Customer C: Billie Eilish, Ed Sheeran, Ariana Grande<!--D-->
--

- How do we measure which customers have similar taste and which have different taste?

---

# Jaccard Similarity and Distance
 
- Jaccard similarity gives us a measure of how close two *sets* are, in this case the set of each customers favourite musician.  The formula is
$$J(A,B)=\frac{|A\cap B|}{|A\cup B|}$$
- Where $|A\cap B|$ is the number of elements in both set A and set B and $|A\cup B|$ is the number of elements in either set A or set B.

---

# Jaccard Similarity

- In our example<!--D-->
--

  + $A\cap B = \left\{\mbox{Post Malone, Lil Peep}\right\}$ 
  + $|A\cap B|=2$
  + $\begin{align}A\cup B =& \{\mbox{Post Malone, Lil Peep,}\\& \mbox{Drake, Billie Eilish, Juice Wrld}\}\end{align}$ 
  + $|A\cup B|=5$<!--D-->
--

- The Jaccard similarity will be $J=2/5=0.4$.  The Jaccard *distance* is $d_J=1-J=1-0.4=0.6$

---

# Using dummy variables
 
- Alternatively the same data can be coded using dummy variables:<!--D-->
--

  + $X_{j}=1$ if artist $j$ is a favourite of customer $x$
  + $X_{j}=0$ otherwise<!--D-->
--

- The usual distance measures such as Euclidean or Manhattan distance can then be used.

# Recommender Systems

- Famous recommender systems are used by Amazon, Netflix, Alibaba amongst others.
- These systems are usually a hybrid of 
  - Collaborative Filtering
  - Content-based Filtering
- The method we discussed is more specifically called memory-based collaborative filtering.

# Axioms of Distance

- Care should be taken when using the word distance.
- In formal mathematics a distance is a function with two inputs that has to satisfy four properties.
- These four properties are called *axioms*.
- The distance measures that we have discussed satisfy the axioms

---

# Axioms of Distance

1. Non-negative: $d(x,y)\ge 0$
  - There cannot be negative distance.
2. Symmetry: $d(x,y)=d(y,x)$
  - It cannot be a different distance from Melbourne to Brisbane that from Brisbane to Melbourne.

---

# Axioms of Distance

3. Identity of indiscernables: if $d(x,y)=0$ then $x=y$ and vice versa
  - The distance from Melbourne to some place is zero then that place is Melbourne.  Similarly the distance from Melbourne to itself is zero.
4. Triangle inequality: $d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z)$ 
  It cannot be closer to go from Melbourne to Brisbane via Sydney than it is to go from Melbourne to Brisbane directly.

---

# Conclusions
 
- That concludes the topic on distance.<!--D-->
--

- This is relevant to the following topics<!--D-->
--

  + Cluster Analysis<!--D-->
--

  + Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)<!--D-->
--

- Now an exercise

# Distances between tweets
 

- Find someone on Twitter or a similar social media site
  + Find the first two tweets
  + Think of a way to compute a Jaccard distance between their tweets
- Hint: Think of the words used in the tweet as a *set*
